# Datathon-Reviewer-Instructions

Thanks for being a reviewer and/or chair at Datathon 2019!

Note: if you see anything about "Meta-Reviewers" or "Senior Meta-Reviewers," please ignore that. We will only be using the regular "Reviewer" functionality in Microsoft CMT.

Here are the main things you need to know.

## Settings for Deadlines
1. Before participants can submit, and before reviewers can review papers, both of those functionalities (as well as some others) must be "enabled" in the Deadlines section of the Settings page. To get, there click on the following button:

and then click on the Deadline button:

2. You can then set the relevant Deadline settings. An example is shown below:

## Adding Questions for Reviewers

1. To add new questions for Reviewers to answer, stay in the Settings page (see above), and then select the button shown below:

In the far right column, input the MINIMUM number of reviewers for each paper. Then, hit 'Next' in the top right of the screen.

On the next page, which looks like this:

in the far right column, input the MAXIMUM number of papers for each reviewer. Then hit Next.

On the next page, simply click "Run Automatic Assignment" without changing any of the weights/Load Balanced options.

Then click "View Assignment Result"

The assignments will appear on the screen, like so:
